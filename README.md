## Features

- **Secure File Upload:** Upload files with size and format validation.
- **Virus Scanning:** All files are scanned for viruses before processing.
- **Provider Selection:** Users must select a provider before uploading.
- **Error Handling:** User-friendly error messages for all validation and system errors.
- **Upload Summary:** View results and errors for each upload.
- **Search:** Search for previous uploads by file reference.
- **Role-based Access:** Handles forbidden access and error scenarios gracefully.

## Architecture

- **Controller Layer:** Handles HTTP requests and responses.
- **Service Layer:** Business logic for file upload, virus scanning, and search.
- **Helper Classes:** Provider population and utility logic.
- **Thymeleaf Views:** User interface templates for upload, results, and errors.

## Technologies

- Java 17+
- Spring Boot
- Gradle
- Thymeleaf
- JUnit 5, MockMvc (testing)
- Mockito (mocking dependencies)
- Docker

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Java 17 or higher
- Gradle (or use the Gradle wrapper)
- (Optional) Docker for running dependencies
- Install Docker desktop (https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop)

Ensure you have the following environment variables set for local development:



### Build

Clone the repository and build the project:

```sh
git clone git@github.com:ministryofjustice/laa-cwa-bulk-upload.git
cd laa-cwa-bulk-upload
./gradlew clean build
```
### Wiremock
export WIREMOCK_PORT=8090
export WIREMOCK_HOST=localhost
All Wiremock stubs are located in `src/wiremock/mappings/cwa-service`
Before running the application, ensure Wiremock is running on port 8090.
You can start it using Docker compose  : `docker-compose up` (from the root of the project)
Ensure cwa-api.url in your local application yaml is set to 'http://localhost:8090' to point to wiremock.

### Local Application Properties
export CWA_API_URL=http://localhost:8090
export CWA_API_TIMEOUT=20

### Run

Start the application locally:

```sh
./gradlew bootRun
```

The app will be available at [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080).

### Configuration

You can configure the maximum upload file size and other properties in `src/main/resources/application.properties`:

```
upload-max-file-size=10MB
```

Other configuration options (e.g., CWA API endpoints, authentication) can be added as needed.

## Usage

1. **Open the application** in your browser at [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080).
2. **Select a provider** from the dropdown.
3. **Choose a file** to upload (must be under the configured size limit and virus-free).
4. **Submit the form** to upload.
5. **View the results** or any error messages.
6. **Search** for previous uploads using the file reference and provider.

## Testing

Run all unit and integration tests:

```sh
./gradlew test
```

Test coverage includes:

- Controller logic (file upload, error handling, search)
- Service layer (mocked in controller tests)
- Validation and error scenarios
